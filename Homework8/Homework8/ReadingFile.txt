The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that 
use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion 
devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions 
of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked 
by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive 
range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of 
the World Wide Web (WWW), the infrastructure to support email, 
and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing and telephony.
The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned 
by the United States government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant 
communication via computer networks. This work, combined with efforts in the United 
Kingdom and France, led to the primary precursor network, the ARPANET, in the United States. The interconnection 
of regional academic networks in the 1980s marks the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet. From 
the early 1990s, the network experienced sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and 
mobile computers were connected to it.
